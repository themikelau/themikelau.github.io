I am a PhD student in the [School of Physics & Astronomy](https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/physics) at Monash University, currently visiting the [Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) as a Research Analyst. My main research interests are in binary stellar interactions, common-envelope evolution, and the formation of gravitational wave sources.

I am a member of the [COMPAS](https://compas.science/) team, which is a collaborative effort to study isolated binary evolution through rapid population synthesis of massive binary stars. I am also a member of [OzGrav](https://www.ozgrav.org/) and an associate member of the [LISA Consortium](https://www.elisascience.org/).
